# WordPress ACF Flat URL Structure

When using ACF, via plugin or with PHP code, this will help you get a flat URL structure from your CPTs.

## ACF Plugin Settings

Here is our settings using the ACF plugin. You will want to make sure that your plugin settings are the same, or that your code solution matches this setup.

## Custom PHP Code

Using our code, paste it in your `functions.php` file, or using a custom code plugin. We use Advanced Scripts, but something like Code Snippets would also work.
